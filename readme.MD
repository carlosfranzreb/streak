# Streak Manager

Streak is a CRM platform that works inside Gmail. It has a free version where shared pipeline can have max. 50 tickets. Therefore, for the sake of extending the trial period, this script retrieves resolved tickets through Streak's API and stores them in a CSV file.

There is also a script to analyse various features of the pipelines, such as the avg. time for a ticket to be resolved, the load on each employee and several others.

These files could then be stored Google Drive. However, this functionality has not been implemented yet.
